# Step 1: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=0.9)  # Retain 90% of variance
reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(nmr_data)

# Select features using RL agent

# Define a function for adaptive normalization

    # `alpha` is dynamically determined by the RL agent
    # This function would update the mean and std for each feature based on the new data point

# Normalize the selected features using adaptive normalization
